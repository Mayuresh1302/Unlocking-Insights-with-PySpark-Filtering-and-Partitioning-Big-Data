This PySpark code creates a Spark session, defines a schema for reading data from a CSV file, 
and performs some operations on the data and then the Data is partitioned by the age column, which means files will be organized into directories based on age.
The primary objective is to filter and process a dataset of "friends" and save the results to an output file.
